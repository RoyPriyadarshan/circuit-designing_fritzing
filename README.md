# circuit-designing_fritzing
This contains circuits of multiple porjects with many compatible sensors and components
These projects can be used summer training porjects as it is consists of simple arduino uno and sensors such as ultarsonic,DHT,IR etc.
These projects requires a basic understanding of circuitry and a good skill level for the porgramming of the respective boards.
Further changes or upgradation in these projects are gladly appreciated.
